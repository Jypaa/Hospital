# Hospital

wanted to create bit further from one of school task example

How to use 

1. clone

2. "npm install" both backend and frontend folders

3. Add ".env to backend folder

   example backend .env:
  
       SECRET= secret
       NODE_ENV="test"
  
4. run "npm run dev" on both folders and it works in development environment
